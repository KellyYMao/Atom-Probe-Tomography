# Atom-Probe-Tomography Overview
Atom Probe Tomography (APT) uses field evaporation and a high voltage laser to ionize and remove surface atoms. The ions are accelerated and detected. The position-sensisitive detector helps to determine the identity and position of the atom. A three-dimensional construction of the specimen can then be made. 

# LEAP5000XS
LEAP5000XS is a local electron atom probe at Northwestern. This was the specific atom probe I was able to work with. LEAP5000XS has 80% detection efficiency. It uses an ultraviolet laser to assist in ion evporation.
