# Atom-Probe-Tomography Overview
Atom Probe Tomography (APT) uses field evaporation and a high voltage laser to ionize and remove surface atoms. The ions are accelerated and detected. The position-sensisitive detector helps to determine the identity and position of the atom. A three-dimensional construction of the specimen can then be made. 

# LEAP5000XS
LEAP5000XS is a local electron atom probe at Northwestern. This was the specific atom probe I was able to work with. LEAP5000XS has 80% detection efficiency. It uses an ultraviolet laser to assist in ion evporation.

# Specimen Preparation 
The electric field tends to penetrate more deeply into non-metallic materials than in metallic materials. Thus, since the electric field is not able to penetrate metallic materials very well, the specimen can be screened atomic-layer by atomic-layer. Likewise, the tendency for the electric field to penetrate more deeply into non-metallic materials can cause the formation of undesired complex ions. The specimens used are generally at the nanoscale level. One approach to specimen preparation is focused ion beam (FIB). FIB uses a highly focused beam of ions (ex. gallium ions) in order to modify the surface of the specimen. FIB can be used for milling a specific site. For atom probe specimen preparation, FIB can be used to decreases the inner radius and produce a specimen with a sharp, needle-like tip. The shape of the specimen and the sharp tip is important as it allows for a high electric field to be applied to the surface. If the specimen becomes too blunt, the resulting applied is not enough to induce evaporation. 

# Field Evaporation
An electric field is applied and used to separate a surface-atom from its latice. In the process, the atom is ionized. The exact mechanisms of field evporation are still debated. Generally, it is thought that either the atom is fully ionized prior to evaporation or the while the atom is being evporated, charge is progressively drained. 

The atom must overcome the energy-barrier binding it to the surface. The height of this energy barrier can be calculated with from the following formula:

The evaporation field or the value of the field at which the energy barrier for surface evaporation is zero can be calculated using the following formula:
