# Atom-Probe-Tomography Overview
Atom Probe Tomography (APT) uses field evaporation and a high voltage laser to ionize and remove surface atoms. The ions are accelerated and detected. The position-sensitive detector helps to determine the identity and position of the atom. A three-dimensional construction of the specimen can then be made.

# Atom Probe With Steel 
The atom probe was used to analyze a sample of DOW steel. This Ni-Cr alloy has oxide layers. The purpose of using the atom probe with this steel was to analyze its composition in order to determine structural and compositional factors that may lead the oxide layer to fail/metal dusting to occur. 

# LEAP5000XS
LEAP5000XS is the local electron atom probe at Northwestern. This was the specific atom probe we worked with. LEAP5000XS has 80% detection efficiency. It uses an ultraviolet laser to assist in ion evporation.

# How The Atom Probe Works
A specimen is mounted to a stage that can move in three directions. The specimen is held at cryogenic temperatures. A laser pulse helps to initiate the evaporation of ions. These ions are then accelerated by a local electrode and follow electric field lines until reaching the detector. Their impact with the position-sensitive detector is recorded. The specimen can then be reconstructed atom by atom based on the recorded data.

# Specimen Preparation 
The electric field tends to penetrate more deeply into non-metallic materials than in metallic materials. Thus, since the electric field is not able to penetrate metallic materials very well, the specimen can be screened atomic-layer by atomic-layer. Likewise, the tendency for the electric field to penetrate more deeply into non-metallic materials can cause the formation of undesired complex ions. The specimens used are generally at the nanoscale level. One approach to specimen preparation is focused ion beam (FIB). FIB uses a highly focused beam of ions (ex. gallium ions) in order to modify the surface of the specimen. FIB can be used for milling a specific site. For atom probe specimen preparation, FIB can be used to decrease the inner radius and produce a specimen with a sharp, needle-like tip. The shape of the specimen and the sharp tip is important as it allows for a high electric field to be applied to the surface. If the specimen becomes too blunt, the resulting applied electric field is not enough to induce evaporation. FIB was used to prepare our specimen for the atom probe. 

# Field Evaporation
An electric field is applied and used to separate a surface-atom from its latice. In the process, the atom is ionized. The exact mechanisms of field evporation are still debated. Generally, it is thought that either the atom is fully ionized prior to evaporation or that while the atom is being evporated, charge is progressively drained.

The atom must overcome the energy-barrier binding it to the surface. The height of this energy barrier can be calculated with from the following formula:

The evaporation field or the value of the field at which the energy barrier for surface evaporation is zero can be calculated using the following formula:

# Evaporation Rate
The formula for evaporation rate is as follows:  
![Image](/Equations/Evaporation_Rate.png)  
The actual evporation rate at high and low temperatures tends to deviate from the equation above. Ion tunneling (electrons that are able to overcome the energy barrier required to escape from the atom) can occur at low temperatures in which the evporation may become less temperature-dependent.  
There are two ways to control the rate of evaporation. Either the temperature is held constant with a varying electric field or the electric field is held constant with varying temperature. 

# Time Of Flight
The time of flight measures the time is takes for the ion to be detected.  
The time of flight can be approximately determined using the following:  
![Image](/Equations/Time_Of_Flight.png)  
The greater the mass, the lower the velocity, and the longer the time of flight. The mass can then be used to determine chemical identity. The m/z ratio is used in creating a mass spectra which helps to identify what elements and molecules are in the specimen.   

# Electrostatic Pressure & Stress
Atom probe analysis is tends to be more successful with ductile materials than with brittle materials. Electrostatic pressure can induce stress on the specimen which can result in fractures. The type of material, shape of the specimen, size of radius, etc., are factors that can be changes in order to reduce the risk of fracture due to stresses.  

The electrostatic pressure can be desrcibed by the following:

# Multiple-Hit Capacity
Ions can arrive very close together (similar location) or at nearly the same time. When ions arrive close together, the electrical signal may overlap, causing the arrival of the two ions to be recorded as a single event. 

# Inside The Atom Probe

The specimen is at the very tip of the prong. The local electrode help to accelerate the ions. Though not visible here, an ultra-violet laser is being directed at the specimen.

# Using The Atom Probe/Procedure
The stage with the specimen is adjusted and moved to the correct position so that the specimen is in-line with the laser.
